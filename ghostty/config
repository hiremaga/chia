# Shift+Enter Key Binding Fix
# ============================================================================
#
# Issue: Ghostty implements the modern "modifyOtherKeys" terminal standard,
# which sends the escape sequence [27;2;13~ for Shift+Enter. While this
# provides more precise key information, many applications and shells don't
# yet recognize this modern sequence and display raw characters: ;2;13~
#
# Solution: Configure Ghostty to send the legacy escape sequence \x1b\r
# that is widely recognized by shells like zsh and applications.

# This ensures Shift+Enter inserts a newline in terminal prompts and
# applications, matching behavior from macOS Terminal and other terminals.
keybind = shift+enter=text:\x1b\r
